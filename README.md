# Markovian-Transformer
Sequential data forms the backbone of numerous real-world applications, such as genome sequencing, speech recognition, and financial trend analysis. While Transformers have become the prevailing architecture for such tasks due to their robust self-attention capabilities, they lack an inherent mechanism to model the natural step-by-step evolution typical of sequential processes. Their attention is position-agnostic by design, which limits their ability to represent the intrinsic progression and localized dynamics of time-dependent data.

In contrast, Markov models are specifically tailored for modeling such localized dependencies through state transition probabilities. These models are adept at encoding short-term temporal patterns but struggle with capturing long-range interactions due to their limited contextual scope and memory capacity.

To leverage the advantages of both paradigms, we propose Markovian Transformers—a unified architecture that combines the sequential modeling strengths of Markov processes with the deep contextual learning of Transformers. Our architecture incorporates a Markovian attention mechanism that explicitly models token-to-token transition probabilities, enabling a structured representation of local dependencies. Simultaneously, a global Transformer head processes the entire sequence context, ensuring the model remains sensitive to long-range relationships and holistic semantic patterns.

This dual mechanism allows Markovian Transformers to seamlessly integrate short-term, probabilistic transitions with rich, global context modeling—offering a comprehensive and powerful approach to learning from complex sequential data.
